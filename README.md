# Kotlin Journey — Business Card App

This repository is part of my **Kotlin learning journey**, where I built a simple **Business Card app** to practice core Android + Kotlin concepts.

## About the project
The **Business Card App** is a small Android app that displays a personal/business profile card (name, role, and contact details). The goal of this project is to get hands-on with Kotlin and basic UI building on Android.

## What I learned / practiced
- Kotlin fundamentals while building a real mini-project
- Creating UI layouts (e.g., arranging text, icons, and sections)
- Working with common UI components like:
  - Text
  - Images / icons
  - Rows / columns / alignment (depending on UI approach used)
- Organizing an Android project structure
- Running and testing the app on an emulator / device

## App features
- Clean business-card style UI
- Shows profile information such as:
  - Name
  - Title / role
  - Phone number
  - Email
  - Social/portfolio link (optional)

## Screenshots
Add screenshots of the app here (recommended):

## How to run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nithingowda381/BuissnessCard.git
   ```
2. Open the project in **Android Studio**
3. Let Gradle sync finish
4. Run the app on an emulator or physical device

## Tech stack
- **Kotlin**
- **Android Studio**
- Android UI (XML or Jetpack Compose, depending on how this app is built)

## My Kotlin journey
This project is one milestone in my Kotlin journey—starting from basics and gradually building small apps to strengthen my understanding through practice.
